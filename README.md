Hello out there

I'm developing a simple notepad, that will be avaible in any OS, to any people use it without issues
Today is hard to find some softwares that is functional in all systems in native form
so I decided to create tools for each one use it, idepedent if your OS is close or open
this will be my mission, the Open Software, open for everyone

I use the library PySide, version 6, and is created using a Virtual Environment (venv)
this library is under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
